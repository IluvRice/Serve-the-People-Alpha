# Serve the People's Lore
The 10-year war in the Taiwan Strait has come to a close. China works towards diplomacy and attempts to increase employment in its capital, Beijing, and build an industrial society, in order to pay off debts from the war and bolster the sagging economy, getting the attention of foreign governments. It is 2007, a country bumpkin named Li moves to the capital to look for a job, later working in a factory and both delivering required products to their location and building products, in the exchange for Credits, which are used to tell the loyalty of a civlian. The job will get harder, as Oliver gets promoted, and if the job is not done correctly, Oliver will lose Credits.
Rebel groups, such as the SCC (Society of Chinese Counterrevolutionaries) will attempt to overthrow the communist dictatorship and establish an oligarchic sham democracy, causing turmoil on Chinese grounds as a message of protest. Li can choose to associate with them or not.
