# Dmitrev
The 20-year Border War has come to a close. Anruska works towards diplomacy and attempts to increase employment in its capital, Dmitrev, to pay off debts from the war and bolster the sagging economy, getting the attention of foreign governments. It is 2204, Oliver Revilo moves to the capital to look for a job, later working in a factory and delivering required products to their location, in the exchange for Seuls, the currency of Anruska. The job will get harder, as Oliver gets promoted, and if the job is not done correctly, Oliver will lose Seuls.
Rebel groups, such as the RAS (Revolutionary Anruskan Society) will attempt to overthrow the communist dictatorship and establish an oligarchic sham democracy, causing turmoil on Anruskan grounds as a message of protest. Oliver can choose to associate with them or not.
